[sport] practice is so boring, Noah said aloud during the middle of a drill.
All we do is move a little to the left and then a little to the right.  I want to learn how to go all the way and make as many points as I can!  Why don't we ever get to really play a game?
It's not that bad, Noah's best friend [name] told him, trying to calm him down.  We need to know how to do all of these [sport] drills so that when we will have practiced them before and can really do it in a game.
I don't need to practice!  [name] watch this move.  
Noah ran faster than anyone had ever seen and charged at the ball near the middle of the field.  Once he reached the ball he gave it a quick boot and it soared high into the goal.
Did you see that [name] I don't need to practice?
The rest of the team gasped in amazement and they began to wonder if practice was so important and they all stopped doing their drills.
But Noah, you wouldn't know what play to make if there 2, 3 or more defenders on you or you wouldn't know exactly how hard to pass the ball to Russell if he had an easier goal or you wouldn't know where to move in order to make the game winning goal...
Noah, thought aloud ...unless I practiced.  
The rest of the team seemed relieved to know that they were all practicing so that they would each be ready to make a great play in their next game.  They liked to practice because it meant spending time with their friends, having fun exercising and they really liked it when their skills improved making them closer to being just like [playername].
Noah said to the group, Well if practicing our [sport] drills is so important then we should end each practice with a team cheer!  The more we practice then the louder we should cheer.
All of the team agreed and since everyone had the same favourite team they began their cheer with:
Good old [teamname]!  We're proud to say that name! Whenever we sing this song, we'll win the game!
